<p>Thistle is a HTML template engine for NodeJS that, unlike many other template systems, operates on
a DOM-like structure rather than on raw strings.</p>
<p>DOM-based templating adds a little more overhead (which thistle attempts to minimize) but in return allows
for more expressiveness via custom <em>directives</em> that allow for creating reusable template components and
other reusable functionality.</p>
<p>Thistle is inspired by (but not entirely compatible with) <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/templates">AngularJS templates</a>.
Thistle attempts to provide much of the expressive power of AngularJS while optimizing for fast template
rendering.</p>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Instantiate a <code>thistle</code> instance to begin:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var thistle = require(&#39;thistle&#39;);
var compiler = thistle();
</code></pre>
<p>By default the compiler has the basic, built-in directives and filters loaded. Templates using just these
features can be compiled:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var render = compiler.compile(&#39;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li thi-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot;&gt;{{ item }}&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>compile</code> method returns a function that takes a scope and returns a rendered DOM. A scope is just a
plain old JavaScript object whose keys become variables for the template:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var nodes = render({items:[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]});
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll usually want to render the resulting DOM as a string of HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">console.log(compiler.serializeHtml(nodes));
</code></pre>
<p>This basic example then results in the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;b&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;c&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Most ‘real’ applications will compile all of the necessary templates once during startup and then render
them many times with different data. Thus <code>thistle</code> is designed to do extra preparation work during
compilation in order to enable faster rendering.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>Thistle is still under early development and thus its interface is still subject to change until a
1.0.0 release is reached. More implementation experience is required before we can confidently commit
to an interface.</p>
